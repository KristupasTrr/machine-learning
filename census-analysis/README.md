# Census income dataset analysis

Here we analyze US census income data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income to answer the following questions:

1. What is the correlation between education and income?
2. How well can we predict if person makes over 50K a year using different classification algorithms (KNN, SVM, DT)?
3. Does neural network predict better than classification algorithms (KNN, SVM, DT)?"
